# Process Before Automation

## Daily Work for IS Team Members

- **Morning:** Check HubSpot for meetings, manually send reminder emails (30 minutes)
- **Per Call:** Copy transcript from Miitel, create summary manually, update call logs, sync FS calendars (15-20 minutes per call)
- **Total:** 2.5-3.5 hours daily on admin tasks
- **Problems:** Time-consuming, repetitive, error-prone, inconsistent

## Impact
- Only 25% of time spent on actual selling
- Missed reminders, delayed updates
- Team burnout from manual work

---

# Why This Automation is Necessary

## Current Challenges
- **Time Waste:** IS team spends 60-70% time on admin tasks instead of selling
- **Human Errors:** Manual data entry leads to mistakes in summaries and updates
- **Inconsistency:** Different team members create summaries differently
- **Delays:** Calendar updates and reminders happen late or not at all
- **Scalability:** Manual processes don't work well as the team grows

## Business Impact
- Reduced productivity and sales capacity
- Poor customer experience from missed communications
- High team stress and turnover risk
- Can't handle more calls or meetings efficiently

---

# What We Aim to Change

## Our Goals
