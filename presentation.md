# Process Before Automation

## Daily Work for IS Team Members

Imagine a typical day:

- **Morning:** Check meetings in HubSpot, write and send reminder emails by hand (30 minutes)
- **Each Call:** Listen to call recording, copy notes, write summary, update customer records, add to team calendars (15-20 minutes per call)
- **Total:** 2.5-3.5 hours every day on boring tasks
- **Problems:** Takes too long, boring, mistakes happen, different people do it differently

## What happens because of this?
- Only 25% of time used for real selling work
- Sometimes forget to send reminders
- Updates happen late
- Team feels tired and unhappy

---

# Why This Automation is Necessary

## What's wrong now?
- **Waste of Time:** Team spends most time on computer work, not talking to customers
- **Mistakes:** People make errors when typing summaries or updating calendars
- **Not the Same:** Each person writes summaries in their own way
- **Late Updates:** Reminders and calendars get updated slowly or forgotten
- **Can't Grow:** As team gets bigger, the manual work becomes too much

## What happens if we don't fix this?
- Team can't do more sales calls
- Customers get bad service (missed reminders)
- People feel stressed and want to quit
- Business doesn't grow

---

# What We Aim to Change

## Our Goals
- **Save Time:** Cut boring work from 3.5 hours to 10 minutes per day
- **Better Work:** Summaries and updates are always correct and look the same
- **No Manual Work:** Everything happens automatically - no typing or copying needed
- **Do More:** Handle 50% more calls and meetings
- **Happy Team:** Focus on fun selling work, less stress

## What We Bring
- **Zapier Tool:** Connects our tools (HubSpot, Miitel, Google Calendar, Gmail) together
- **Smart AI:** Writes summaries for us (uses OpenAI, no coding needed)
- **Instant Updates:** Everything syncs right away
- **Easy to Start:** Takes 2-4 weeks, costs about $600 per year

---

# What is Zapier? (Simple Explanation)

Zapier is like a robot assistant that connects different apps.

**Example:**
- When something happens in HubSpot (like a new meeting)
- Zapier notices it
- Then it does tasks in other apps (like sending email or updating calendar)

No coding needed - just click and connect!

# Flow of the Automation Process

## Overview
We use Zapier to automate 3 main tasks:
1. Meeting Reminders (send emails automatically)
2. Call Summaries (write notes automatically)
3. Calendar Sync (update team calendars automatically)

Everything starts automatically - you don't do anything!
